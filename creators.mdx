## Why creators use Flaire today
- Campaigns only show up after brands prove they own the product they want promoted, and brands can invite you directly when they already have someone in mind.
- Every application you submit doubles as the agreement, so there is no guessing about payment splits or revision limits.
- Brands must pay as soon as they approve your agreement, which means budgets are locked before you start working.
- Every creator connects at least one social account during signup so Flaire can verify authenticity and pull analytics directly from the platform.
- Once you post the content and paste the live link back into Flaire, both you and the brand see up to seven days of analytics in the same place, and the final payment auto-releases if the brand stays silent for seven days.

## Quick start roadmap
1. **Set up your profile:** Add a short bio, list the platforms you publish on, and link 1–2 showcase pieces. Connecting at least one active social account is required before you can view campaigns.
2. **Browse the feed:** Filter by category, platform, or delivery date to find campaigns that match your style.
3. **Apply with an agreement:** Flaire asks for your advance amount, final amount, revision count, delivery date, and optional notes each time you apply.
4. **Negotiate in-thread:** If a brand wants changes, you will see their requests right inside the application—no emails required.
5. **Deliver on time:** Once paid, create the content, paste the live link into Flaire after posting, and watch the shared analytics update for seven days.
