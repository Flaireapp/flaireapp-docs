## Overview
Brands cannot edit your agreement fields directly, so they respond with requests. Each time you update the agreement, Flaire version-tracks the changes so both sides can review what changed before the brand approves and pays.

## Negotiation controls
- **Edit advance/final amount:** Tap *View campaign agreement* on the campaign chat to tweak your numbers. Flaire shows the previous values to everyone in the thread.
- **Change delivery date:** Pick a new date if shipping or creative timelines shift.
- **Adjust revisions:** Increase or decrease the number of revisions you are willing to include.
- **Notes:** Add clarifications, shoot ideas, or answers to brand questions.

## Recommended flow
1. Read the brand’s feedback carefully; they’ll usually note what needs to change.
2. Update the agreement fields in one pass so the brand sees a complete proposal.
3. Reiterate any context in the notes (e.g., “New final payment includes usage for 30 days”).
4. Hit **Send agreement** and wait for the brand’s approval or next request.

## Protect yourself
- Keep all communication in Flaire. If you negotiate elsewhere, we can’t help resolve disputes.
- Do not start production until the brand approves and you receive the advance.
- If a brand goes silent, you can withdraw your application and move on without penalty.
