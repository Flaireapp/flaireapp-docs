## Overview
Deliverables in Flaire live inside the same conversation where you negotiated the agreement. The thread keeps everything organized—uploads, approvals, and now the lightweight seven-day analytics tab that turns on once you paste the live link.

## Submit the final asset
1. Upload the finished file directly in the thread.
2. Add a short note covering the caption, hashtags, or talking points the brand needs.
3. Clearly label the message as **Final delivery** so the brand knows this is the version tied to payment.
4. Once the content is live on your platform, copy the public link and paste it into the **connect post** page.

## After submission
- After you post and share the live link, Flaire tracks basic analytics (reach, engagement rate, clicks, saves) for seven days. Both you and the brand can refresh the tab anytime.
- Analytics only appear if both you and the brand connected your social accounts during signup, so make sure your connections stay active.
- If the brand requests another revision and you still have rounds remaining, upload the updated file in the same thread.
- Once the brand clicks approves, Flaire releases the remaining payment automatically.

## Proof-of-posting
- Always paste the live link plus any required screenshots so both Flaire and the brand can confirm the content is live.
- If the link changes (e.g., you need to re-upload), update it immediately—analytics only run on the most recent link.

## Keep records for yourself
- Download the thread as a PDF (coming soon) or copy the key details into your own tracker.
- Save the receipts emailed by Flaire.
- Screenshot the shared analytics if you want to include performance in your media kit later.
