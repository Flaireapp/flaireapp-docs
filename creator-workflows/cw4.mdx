## Overview
Deliverables in Flaire live inside the same conversation where you negotiated the agreement. The thread keeps everything organized—uploads, approvals, and now the lightweight seven-day analytics tab that turns on once you paste the live link.

## Submit the final asset
1. Upload the finished file directly in the thread (videos up to 200 MB, images up to 25 MB).
2. Add a short note covering the caption, hashtags, or talking points the brand needs.
3. Clearly label the message as **Final delivery** so the brand knows this is the version tied to payment.
4. Once the content is live on your platform, copy the public link and paste it into the same thread. Tag the brand and @FlaireSupport so they’re alerted instantly—this also opens the analytics tab for both of you.

## After submission
- The brand has up to three business days to review drafts. You’ll see status badges like *Awaiting review*, *Revision requested*, or *Approved*.
- After you post and share the live link, Flaire tracks basic analytics (reach, engagement rate, clicks, saves) for seven days. Both you and the brand can refresh the tab anytime.
- Analytics only appear if both you and the brand connected your social accounts during signup, so make sure your connections stay active.
- If the brand requests another revision and you still have rounds remaining, upload the updated file in the same thread.
- Once the brand clicks **Approve**, Flaire releases the remaining payment automatically. If they don’t respond within seven days of you posting the link, the payment releases automatically.

## Proof-of-posting
- Always paste the live link plus any required screenshots so both Flaire and the brand can confirm the content is live.
- If the link changes (e.g., you need to re-upload), update it immediately—analytics only run on the most recent link.

## Keep records for yourself
- Download the thread as a PDF (coming soon) or copy the key details into your own tracker.
- Save the receipts emailed by Flaire—they’re the only financial documents generated for the campaign.
- Screenshot the shared analytics if you want to include performance in your media kit later.
