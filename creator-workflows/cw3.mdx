## Overview
Production starts only after you see the **Approved & paid** status. From that moment until delivery, all communication lives in the same application thread. Flaire does not manage tasks or calendars—use your own tools for deeper tracking and rely on Flaire for the official agreement and revision counter.

## Staying organized
1. **Confirm inputs** – make sure you’ve received any products, scripts, or guardrails from the brand.
2. **Plan the shoot** – schedule time so you can hit the deliverable date you committed to.
3. **Upload drafts** – share files directly in the thread (max 200 MB). Mention what changed if you upload multiple versions.
4. **Monitor revision count** – Flaire shows how many revision rounds you have left. Once you hit the cap, the brand must open a new agreement for extra work.
5. **Submit finals** – clearly label the final file so the brand knows it’s the version tied to payment.
6. **Prep your posting window** – note the time you’ll publish, capture any tracking links or captions provided, and line up the exact URL you’ll paste back into Flaire once the content is live.

## Requesting changes
- If something threatens your timeline (shipping delays, illness), propose a new delivery date inside the thread before the deadline passes.
- Need to update payment amounts? Ask the brand to end the current campaign and start a new agreement—this keeps records clean.
- If you realize you can’t post on the agreed date, notify the brand and Flaire support in the same message so the auto-payment timer pauses until the new schedule is confirmed.

## Communication etiquette
- Keep replies concise and cite the timestamp or scene you’re discussing.
- Avoid moving to DM/email. Staying in Flaire protects you if disagreements pop up.
- Share any posting instructions you need (caption text, hashtags) so the brand can confirm before you go live.
