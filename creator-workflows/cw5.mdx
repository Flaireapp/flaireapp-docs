## Overview
Flaire processes two payments per campaign: an optional advance that lands right after approval and the remaining balance that arrives once the brand signs off on your final delivery. There is no wallet to manage—funds go straight to the payout method you verified during signup.

## Payment lifecycle
| Stage | What you see | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agreement approved | Status changes to **Approved & paid** | Advance (if requested) transfers to your payout method. |
| Production | Status shows **In production** | Flaire holds the final payment until you deliver and the brand approves. |
| Link submitted | Status switches to **Posted** | Flaire opens a seven-day analytics window and starts the auto-release timer. |
| Final approval / auto-release | Status switches to **Complete** | Remaining balance releases either when the brand approves or automatically seven days after your link submission if they stay silent. |

## Keep payments smooth
- Double-check your payout details before you apply. Changing accounts mid-campaign pauses releases until support re-verifies you.
- Request only the advance you need for production. Brands see the split and expect you to honor it.
- Deliver on or before the date you agreed to. If you need more time, propose a new date inside the thread so the brand can approve it.
- Paste the live link right after you post and tag the brand plus Flaire. The auto-release timer doesn’t start until the link is captured.

## Tracking receipts
- Flaire emails a receipt each time money moves. Save those emails or forward them to your accountant.
- You can also download a PDF copy from **Settings → Payment history** (Coming soon).

## When something feels off
- If a release is late, confirm the brand actually clicked **Approve** or whether seven days have passed since you posted the link.
