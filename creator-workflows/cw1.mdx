## Overview
Every campaign inside Flaire is public to verified creators (and brands can invite you directly via private links). Your application is both the pitch and the agreement, so you only need to fill out one form to share pricing, revisions, and deadlines. Brands cannot edit your application directly—they can only request updates that you accept or decline.

## Before you apply
- Confirm the campaign matches your platform and audience.
- Make sure you can meet the listed deliverable date or propose a new one.
- Gather any proof-of-work links you want to include in the notes section.

## Completing the agreement form
1. **Advance payment** – optional upfront amount you need before production. Many creators use this for props or studio time.
2. **Final payment** – the remaining amount due after the brand accepts the deliverable.
3. **Revision limit** – choose how many rework cycles you are willing to include (0–3).
4. **Deliverable date** – pick the date you can hand in the finished content.
5. **Notes** – add concepts, references, or requirements (sample delivery address, NDA, etc.).

## Strengthen your application
- Mention why your audience cares about the product in one sentence.
- Link past collaborations or media kits inside the notes field.
- Call out anything you need from the brand upfront (coupon codes, product shipping deadlines).

## After submission
- Your application appears immediately in the brand’s campaign thread.
- Brands typically respond within three business days. You will get an email plus an in-app notification.
- Keep communication inside Flaire—everything you agree to in the thread is what support references if issues arise.
