## Plan overview

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

- *Campaigns you can apply to* counts applications to public briefs and invited campaigns.
- *Direct invitations* are the private collaborations you can accept per month (brands can still message you, but you must free up an invite slot to accept).

## How to upgrade
1. Open **Settings → Membership**.
2. Choose the tier that matches your pitching volume (upgrades activate immediately, downgrades apply on the next cycle).
3. Confirm the billing method (card, bank debit, or existing wallet balance).
4. Accept the updated Creator Agreement and tap **Upgrade now**.

## Keep your documents current
- Re-upload your ID and business info whenever something changes so payouts stay compliant.
- Update payout methods before you request advances to avoid holds.
- Maintain at least one connected social profile; analytics for invites/campaigns only appear when both sides keep their connections active.

## Working with advances
- The advance amount you request is paid right after a brand approves. Only ask for what you need to start production.
- Flaire releases the remaining balance when the brand approves or automatically seven days after you paste the live link (if the brand is silent).

## Taking a break
Toggle **Snooze applications** to stop receiving invitations temporarily. Existing campaigns stay active, and you can unsnooze anytime without losing your membership tier.
