## Build straightforward collaborations
Flaire currently focuses on a single workflow: verified brands can post campaigns, and creators can respond with a clear agreement that covers payments, revisions, and delivery dates. 

## First-day checklist for brand teams
1. **Verify ownership:** Upload a recent proof-of-ownership document (business registration, utility bill, trademark certificate etc.) so the Flaire team can confirm you represent the brand.
2. **Connect your socials:** Link at least one official brand account (Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube). Flaire uses this to confirm authenticity and to populate campaign analytics once content is live.
3. **Complete your profile:** Add contact details, a short brand overview, and any creative guardrails so creators understand how you work.
4. **Post your first campaign:** Use the lightweight campaign form to describe the product and the content you expect. You can also invite specific creators if you already know who you’d like to work with.
5. **Review applications:** Every creator response already includes advance + full payment amounts, revision limits, deliverable dates, and optional notes so you can make a decision without back-and-forth.
6. **Fund the agreement:** Once you accept a creator’s proposal, send payment directly through Flaire so production can begin. Creators are notified to post the content and paste the live link back into the campaign so both parties can see performance snapshots.
