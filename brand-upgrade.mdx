## Plan overview
| Plan | Campaigns / month | Collaborations / month | Invites / month | Included features |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Free** | 1 | 3 | 1 | Core messaging + payouts |
| **Spark** | 3 | 6 | Unlimited | Creator search, no platform/campaign fees |
| **Blaze** | 6 | 12 | Unlimited | Creator search, Creator Analytics, no platform/campaign fees |
| **Supernova** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | Creator search, Advanced Creator Analytics, no platform/campaign fees |

- *Campaigns / month* is the number of briefs you can keep live simultaneously.
- *Collaborations / month* reflects how many agreements you can fund and deliver each month.
- *Invites* control how many private campaign links you can send outside the public feed (Spark+ plans remove the cap entirely).

## How to upgrade
1. Navigate to **Workspace Settings → Limits**.
2. Select **Change plan** and choose the tier that fits your campaign volume.
3. Confirm your billing details (a plan can be billed monthly or annually; platform and campaign fees remain zero for all tiers).
4. Submit the request—new limits activate instantly, and any unused allowances from your previous plan remain available until month end.

## Staying compliant
- Keep your proof-of-ownership document up to date (refresh annually or after any rebrand/acquisition).
- Reconnect your social accounts if analytics stop showing up in the shared dashboard.
- Update the authorized payment method whenever your finance team swaps cards or bank accounts.

## Payment best practices
- Pay only after you approve the creator’s agreement so everyone sees the same locked scope.
- Keep advance/final splits consistent; start a new negotiation if you need to change totals.
- Forward the automatic receipts to your accounting inbox, since there are no additional platform invoices to reconcile.

## Need to slow down?
Downgrade or pause from **Workspace Settings → Limits** anytime. Changes take effect immediately for new campaigns but never cancel agreements you have already funded.
