## Overview
Wrapping a campaign is simple: confirm you received what was promised, release the final payment, and document any notes for future collaborations. Flaire now tracks the live post link and a seven-day analytics snapshot so both sides have the same read before the campaign closes. Receipts are still emailed after each payment for your records.

## Release flow
1. **Creator submits final content and the live link** in the campaign thread, tagging you and Flaire support.
2. **Analytics tab opens** automatically and refreshes for seven days so both parties can watch performance.
3. **You approve or decline** within that window. Approval releases the remaining payment immediately.
4. **Auto-release safety net:** If you take no action within seven days of the creator posting, Flaire releases the final payment automatically (as long as the post link is still valid).
5. **Flaire emails two receipts**—one for the advance (already paid) and one for the final release—so finance can reconcile.

## If something is off
- Use **Request revision** if you still have revision rounds available.
- If the deliverable misses the mark entirely, reply with **Open dispute**. Provide the campaign link, agreement summary, and a clear description of the issue. Flaire mediates within five business days.
- When you and the creator choose to change scope, end the campaign and launch a new negotiation so payments stay accurate.

## Keep your records tidy
- Star the campaign thread in Flaire so you can find it when planning follow-up collaborations.
- Download shared files locally; once a campaign is closed, files remain accessible but are not versioned.
- Forward receipts to your accounting inbox or upload them to your finance stack—there are no exports or APIs today.

## Feedback loop
- Share a short testimonial or constructive feedback with the creator when you close the campaign. It helps them adjust their future agreements.
- Save the analytics snapshot (CSV download coming soon) or screenshot it for your internal recap so your next brief reflects what worked.
