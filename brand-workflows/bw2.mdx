## Overview
Applications arrive as threaded messages tied to each campaign. There is no CRM board to maintain—just open the campaign, read the creator’s agreement, and make a decision. You can also invite creators directly; invited applicants show an *Invited* badge in the thread, but their agreements work the same way. Everything the creator promises is captured in that agreement so finance and creative leads have the same view.

## What each application includes
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Advance payment | Optional upfront amount the creator needs before production |
| Final payment | Total due after you accept the work |
| Revision count | Maximum number of rework cycles included |
| Deliverable date | The date the creator commits to hand over the content |
| Notes | Context like concepts, past work links, shipping needs, or questions |

## Recommended review flow
1. **Skim the overview** to ensure the creator read your brief (check platform match, tone, and concept).
2. **Check the payment split** and confirm it fits your budget. You can ask the creator to edit either amount before approving.
3. **Validate the deliverable date**. If it conflicts with your launch, reply and propose a new date.
4. **Decide**. Click *Approve & pay* to move forward or *Request changes* to keep negotiating inside the same thread.

## Tips
- Reply within three business days; creators cannot hold multiple approvals at once.
- Keep all questions in Flaire. It preserves the negotiation history if you ever need support.
- If you decline an application, share one sentence of feedback so creators can improve future submissions.
- Use the *Invite creators* button from the campaign to send the brief directly to trusted partners—you’ll still review their agreement inside the same thread.
