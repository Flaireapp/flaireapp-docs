## Overview
Wrapping a campaign is simple: confirm you received what was promised, release the final payment, and document any notes for future collaborations. Flaire now tracks the live post link so both sides have the same read before the campaign closes. Receipts are still emailed after each payment for your records.

## Release flow
1. Creator submits final content and the **live link** in the campaign thread.
2. **Analytics tab** activates automatically and refreshes periodically so both parties can watch performance.
3. You **approve or decline** the content once publication is verified. Approval releases the remaining payment immediately.

## If something is off
- **Request a revision** if you still have revision rounds available.
- If the deliverable misses the mark entirely, reply with **Open dispute**. Provide the campaign link, agreement summary, and a clear description of the issue. Flaire mediates within five business days.
- If you and the creator choose to change scope, end the campaign and launch a new negotiation so payments stay accurate.

## Feedback loop
- Share a short testimonial or constructive feedback with the creator when you close the campaign. It helps them adjust their future agreements.
