## Overview
Posting a campaign in Flaire is the only action required before creators can respond. Every campaign captures the basics—what you need made, when you need it, and how you plan to pay—so applicants can reply with a full agreement in one shot.

## Prerequisites
- Brand workspace approved with a valid proof-of-ownership document.
- Clarity on the product or story you want creators to cover.
- A target delivery date and a budget range you are willing to fund.

## Steps
1. Open the **create campaign** form from the Brand home.
2. **Describe the offer** – explain the product, talking points, inspiration and the type of creator you hope to attract.
3. **Set the deliverable date** – share when the final content must be submitted. Creators will reference this date when they apply.
4. **Define revisions** – pick how many revision rounds you are open to (0–3). This limit is visible to creators.
5. **Publish** – review the summary and click *Post*. The campaign appears in the Flaire feed instantly for all verified creators plus anyone you invited directly.
6. **Invite creators (optional)** – after publishing the campaingn you can directly invite creators to collaborate on the platform.

## What creators see
- Your brand description and any mandatory talking points
- The deliverable date and preferred platform or format
- The maximum revisions you will cover
- Any files you attach (product photos, logo lockups, usage notes)

Creators tailor their agreements around this information, so keep it concise and accurate.
