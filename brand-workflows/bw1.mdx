## Overview
Posting a campaign in Flaire is the only action required before creators can respond. Every campaign captures the basics—what you need made, when you need it, and how you plan to pay—so applicants can reply with a full agreement in one shot.

## Prerequisites
- Brand workspace approved with a valid proof-of-ownership document
- At least one official brand social account connected inside Flaire (Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube)
- Clarity on the product or story you want creators to cover
- A target delivery date and a budget range you are willing to fund

## Steps
1. **Open the campaign form** from the Brand home and choose *New campaign*.
2. **Describe the offer** – explain the product, talking points, and the type of creator you hope to attract.
3. **Set the deliverable date** – share when the final content must be submitted. Creators will reference this date when they apply.
4. **Define revisions** – pick how many revision rounds you are open to (0–3). This limit is visible to creators.
5. **Share budget guidance** – enter the total amount you can pay, even if you expect creators to counter.
6. **Invite creators (optional)** – after saving the draft you can copy the private invite link or send email invites to specific creators. Invited creators see the same form plus a note that they were invited directly.
7. **Publish** – review the summary and click *Post*. The campaign appears in the Flaire feed instantly for all verified creators plus anyone you invited directly.

## What creators see
- Your brand description and any mandatory talking points
- The deliverable date and preferred platform or format
- The maximum revisions you will cover
- Any files you attach (product photos, logo lockups, usage notes)

Creators tailor their agreements around this information, so keep it concise and accurate. If details change, edit the campaign—everyone who applied or was invited will be notified.*** End Patch
