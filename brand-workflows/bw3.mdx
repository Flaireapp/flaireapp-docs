## Overview
Approvals in Flaire are binary: you either accept the creator’s agreement and pay, or you ask for edits until you are comfortable funding the work. There are no external contracts or tools. Once you approve, the payment moves immediately and the creator begins production.

## Negotiation loop
1. **Review the agreement** the creator submitted (advance, final amount, revisions, date, notes).
2. **Request edits** if you need different numbers. Flaire keeps the thread tidy by showing each revision so it is clear what changed.
3. **Accept** when everything looks right. You will see the total charge and be prompted to pay.

## Payment flow
| Step | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Approve & pay | Your saved card/bank is charged for the full amount (advance + final). |
| Release advance | Flaire automatically sends the advance to the creator so they can start production. |
| Hold remainder | The final payment remains reserved until you mark the deliverable as received. |

## If you disagree
- Use **Request changes** to propose new amounts or a new delivery date.
- Share specific feedback so the creator knows exactly what to update.
- You can back out entirely by choosing **Decline**; funds are not captured unless you approve.

## After approval
- The campaign status switches to *In production*.
- You receive reminders seven days and one day before the agreed deliverable date.
- The creator cannot change payment terms without opening a new negotiation thread.
- When the creator posts, they tag you and Flaire with the live link so analytics can start and the final payment timer can begin.
