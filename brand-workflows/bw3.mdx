## Overview
Once you find the right creator, approve their agreement to kick off production. Flaire holds funds in escrow until the deliverable is approved, so both sides are protected from day one.

## Approval flow
1. **Review the final agreement** — confirm the advance, final payment, revision count, and delivery date one last time.
2. **Click Approve & Pay** — Flaire charges your payment method and deposits the full amount into escrow. The advance (if any) releases to the creator immediately.
3. **Production begins** — the creator is notified and the campaign status moves to *In production*. All communication stays in the same thread.

## What to watch for
- Make sure the creator's payout details are confirmed before you approve — changes mid-campaign can delay releases.
- If anything feels off after approval, open a dispute through the campaign thread within seven days of the delivery deadline.

## If you get stuck
