## 2. How we use information
We process data to:

2. Facilitate contracts, payments, escrow, and dispute resolution between brands and creators
3. Monitor the safety and integrity of the marketplace, including fraud prevention and compliance checks
4. Communicate with you about updates, onboarding, surveys, or transactional notices
5. Improve and develop new features, including training internal models on aggregated and anonymized insights
6. Meet legal, tax, and regulatory obligations

## 3. Legal bases for processing
If you are in the European Economic Area or UK, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases: contract performance, legitimate interests (e.g., product improvement, security), legal obligations, and consent (for marketing or optional data sharing). You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting prior processing.

## 4. How we share information
We share information with:
- Service providers that host infrastructure, payment gateways, analytics, customer support, and identity verification
- Other users (brands or creators) when necessary to fulfill a campaign, following the permissions you set
- Partners or authorities if required by law, regulation, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Flaire or others
- Buyers or investors in the event of a business transaction such as a merger or acquisition (subject to contractual protections)

We do not sell personal data. We also do not allow third parties to use data for their own marketing without your consent.

## 5. Retention
We retain data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. After you close your account, we delete or anonymize data unless we must keep it for legal, tax, accounting, or fraud-prevention purposes.

## 6. Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, correct, download, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data. Submit requests through **Settings → Privacy** or email [privacy@flaireapp.co](mailto:privacy@flaireapp.co). We will verify your identity before responding.

## 7. Security
We use encryption in transit and at rest, access controls, authentication requirements, and routine audits to protect your information. No system is perfect, so please notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access.

## 8. International transfers
Your data may be stored or processed outside your country. When we transfer information across borders, we use approved safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses and security certifications of our infrastructure providers.

## 9. Children
Flaire is intended for users 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us so we can delete it.

## 10. Changes
We may update this Policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. When we make material updates we will notify you via email or in-product banners.
