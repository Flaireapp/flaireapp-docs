# Cookie Policy
_Last updated: 18 November 2025_

This Cookie Policy explains how Astriv Solutions ("Flaire", "we", "us") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit **flaireapp.co**, **web.flaireapp.co**, or any other Flaire property. It also describes the choices you have regarding those technologies.

## 1. What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files that a website stores on your browser or device. They allow the site to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language or login status, so the experience feels consistent.

We also use pixel tags, SDKs, local storage, and other tracking scripts. In this policy we refer to all of these as “cookies”.

## 2. Why we use cookies
We rely on cookies to:
- Keep you signed in securely and route you to the right workspace
- Remember your preferences (language, dark mode, notification settings)
- Measure how the docs and product are used so we can improve navigation and performance
- Detect unusual activity and prevent fraud
- Show relevant announcements about new features, betas, or promotions

## 3. Types of cookies
| Type | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Essential | Required for the platform to function. Without them, sign in, payments, and security features break. | Session ID, CSRF token |
| Preferences | Store custom settings so you do not need to reconfigure each visit. | Language, layout, saved filters |
| Analytics | Help us understand traffic patterns and product health. | Mixpanel, Plausible |
| Marketing | Used on public pages to understand which campaigns drive signups. | Meta Pixel, Google Ads |

## 4. Third-party cookies
Some cookies are set by third parties that provide services on our behalf (analytics, chat, payment processors). Those providers may combine information from Flaire with data from other sites. Review their privacy policies for details about how they process data.

## 5. Your controls
- **Browser settings:** Most browsers let you block or delete cookies. Blocking essential cookies may prevent you from using Flaire.
- **Cookie banner:** When you first visit Flaire, you can opt in or out of non-essential cookies. You can update your choices any time via **Settings → Privacy**.
- **Do Not Track:** We currently do not respond to DNT signals due to lack of industry standards, but we continue to evaluate this approach.

## 6. Updates
We may update this policy. If the changes are material, we will notify you via email or in-app message. Continued use of Flaire after the change becomes effective means you accept the updated policy.
