description: Conditions and process for refunds via Flaire escrow
---

## 1. Definitions

**Escrowed Funds**: The total payment amount committed by the Brand for a specific campaign, held securely by Flaire until the content delivery milestones are met.

**Advance Payment**: A portion of the Escrowed Funds (up to 50% or as mutually agreed upon in the Campaign Agreement) that is released to the Creator prior to final content delivery. Once released, the Advance Payment is deemed non-refundable.

**Non-Delivery**: The Creator's failure to provide the contracted content, including media files, usage rights, or required modifications, within the agreed-upon deadlines and in compliance with the Campaign Agreement and Flaire's Terms of Service.

**Campaign Agreement**: The mutually binding contract created on the Flaire platform detailing the scope of work, content specifications, deadlines, and payment schedule.

## 2. Refund Eligibility and Calculation

### 2.1 Eligibility for Refund

A Brand is eligible for a refund only in cases of confirmed Non-Delivery by the Creator, provided the Brand has followed the dispute resolution process (Section 3).

### 2.2 Refund Amount Calculation

The refund amount will be calculated based on the status of the Escrowed Funds at the time Non-Delivery is confirmed:

1. **Refundable Amount**: The Brand will receive a full refund of any Escrowed Funds that have NOT yet been released to the Creator.
2. **Non-Refundable Amount**: The Brand is NOT eligible for a refund of the Advance Payment (or any other partial payment) already released to the Creator, regardless of the cause of Non-Delivery. This released amount covers the Creator's time, initial preparation, and opportunity costs.

### 2.3 Exclusions

Refunds will not be issued if:

- The non-delivery is a result of the Brand's failure to provide necessary assets, approvals, or instructions as required by the Campaign Agreement.
- The Brand has already approved the content delivery and authorized the final release of all Escrowed Funds.
- The dispute relates to subjective creative differences, and the content provided substantially meets the technical specifications and delivery deadlines defined in the Campaign Agreement.

## 3. Dispute and Refund Process

1. **Dispute Initiation**: The Brand must formally initiate a dispute on the Flaire platform within seven (7) calendar days of the agreed-upon final delivery deadline.
2. **Mediation**: Flaire will attempt to mediate the dispute by reviewing the Campaign Agreement, communications, and evidence of delivery efforts. Both the Brand and the Creator must participate in good faith.
3. **Confirmation of Non-Delivery**: If mediation fails to resolve the issue, and Flaire determines that the Creator failed to meet the fundamental requirements of the Campaign Agreement, Non-Delivery will be confirmed.
4. **Refund Processing**: Upon confirmation of Non-Delivery, Flaire will immediately process the refund for the Refundable Amount (Escrowed Funds minus any Advance Payment) back to the Brand's original payment method. Refunds may take 5â€“10 business days to appear in the Brand's account.

## 4. Creator Obligations

By using the Flaire escrow system, the Creator agrees that any funds remaining in escrow are conditional upon successful delivery. In the event of confirmed Non-Delivery, the Creator will have no claim to the unreleased portion of the Escrowed Funds, which will be returned to the Brand.
