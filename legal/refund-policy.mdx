# Flaire Platform: Refund Policy 

## 1. Definitions
Escrowed Funds: The total payment amount committed by the Client for a specific campaign, held securely by Flaire until the content delivery milestones are met.

Advance Payment: A portion of the Escrowed Funds (up to 50% or as mutually agreed upon in the Campaign Agreement) that is released to the Creator prior to final content delivery. Once released, the Advance Payment is deemed non-refundable by the Creator.

Non-Delivery: The Creator's failure to provide the contracted content within the agreed-upon deadlines and in compliance with the Campaign Agreement and Flaire's Terms of Service.

Campaign Agreement: The mutually binding contract created on the Flaire platform detailing the scope of work, content specifications, deadlines, and payment schedule.

## 2. Refund Eligibility and Calculation
### 2.1 Eligibility for Refund
A Client is eligible for a refund only in cases of confirmed Non-Delivery by the Creator, provided the Client has followed the dispute resolution process (Section 3).

### 2.2 Refund Amount Calculation
Refundable Amount: The Client will receive a full refund of any Escrowed Funds that have not yet been released to the Creator.

Non-Refundable Amount: The Client is not eligible for a refund of the Advance Payment (or any other partial payment) already released to the Creator, regardless of the cause of Non-Delivery.

### 2.3 Exclusions
Refunds will not be issued if:
- The non-delivery is a result of the Client's failure to provide necessary assets, approvals, or instructions as required by the Campaign Agreement.
- The Client has already approved the content delivery and authorized the final release of all Escrowed Funds.
- The dispute relates to subjective creative differences, and the content provided substantially meets the technical specifications and delivery deadlines defined in the Campaign Agreement.

## 3. Dispute and Refund Process
Dispute Initiation: The Client must formally initiate a dispute on the Flaire platform within seven (7) calendar days of the agreed-upon final delivery deadline.

Mediation: Flaire will attempt to mediate the dispute by reviewing the Campaign Agreement, communications, and evidence of delivery efforts. Both the Client and the Creator must participate in good faith.

Confirmation of Non-Delivery: If mediation fails to resolve the issue, and Flaire determines that the Creator failed to meet the fundamental requirements of the Campaign Agreement, Non-Delivery will be confirmed.

Refund Processing: Upon confirmation of Non-Delivery, Flaire will process the refund for the refundable amount back to the Client's original payment method. Refunds may take 5â€“10 business days to appear.

## 4. Creator Obligations
By using the Flaire escrow system, the Creator agrees that any funds remaining in escrow are conditional upon successful delivery. In the event of confirmed Non-Delivery, the Creator will have no claim to the unreleased portion of the Escrowed Funds, which will be returned to the brand.
