# Refund Policy
_Last updated: 18 November 2025_

This policy explains how Astriv Solutions (Pvt) Ltd. (“Flaire”) handles refunds for transactions completed through the Flaire escrow system. The policy forms part of the Terms of Service.

## 1. Definitions
- **Brand** – the client funding a campaign.
- **Creator** – the talent providing deliverables.
- **Escrowed Funds** – money deposited by the Brand and held by Flaire until deliverables are approved.
- **Advance Release** – any portion of funds paid to the Creator before final approval (e.g., production advances).
- **Non-Delivery** – failure to submit deliverables that materially match the approved scope after the agreed grace period.

## 2. Eligibility
A refund is considered only when:
1. The Brand deposited funds in escrow and the Creator has not yet received the final payout for the disputed deliverables.
2. The Brand opened a dispute within seven (7) calendar days of the final due date.
3. Both parties participated in Flaire’s mediation process in good faith.

Refunds are not granted for subjective creative differences if the deliverables meet the technical requirements described in the Campaign Agreement.

## 3. Calculation
- **Unreleased funds**: 100% returned to the Brand if Non-Delivery is confirmed.
- **Advance releases**: non-refundable except in cases of verified fraud or policy violations.
- **Platform fees**: non-refundable unless the dispute is due to a Flaire system failure.

## 4. Dispute process
1. Brand submits evidence (brief, communication, missing files) through the dispute center.
2. Creator has three business days to respond with counter-evidence.
3. Flaire reviews all materials, may request additional context, and issues a decision within ten business days.
4. Approved refunds are processed to the Brand’s original payment method within five to ten business days.

## 5. Creator obligations
Creators agree that unreleased escrow funds remain conditional on successful delivery. If Flaire confirms Non-Delivery or policy violations, the Creator forfeits any claim to those funds and may face account sanctions.

## 6. Brand obligations
Brands must provide timely feedback, assets, or approvals outlined in the brief. Failure to do so may void refund eligibility. Brands cannot request refunds after approving deliverables or once content has been live for more than seven days.
