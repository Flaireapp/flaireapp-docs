**2.2. Modifications:** Astriv Solutions reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at its discretion. Critical updates (e.g., for security or regulatory compliance) may take immediate effect upon notification. Your continued use of the Platform after any modifications signifies your acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 3. User Eligibility

To use Flaire, you must:

- Be at least 18 years old and legally capable of entering into binding contracts.
- Provide truthful, accurate, and complete registration information.
- Not be prohibited from online or banking activities by any applicable law or regulation.
- Not have conflicting obligations with other influencer services that would prevent your compliance with these Terms.

## 4. Account Creation & Security

**4.1. Registration**: To access Flaire's services, you must register for an Account. This requires a valid email address and a strong, unique password. Brand accounts require a proof of ownership document and creators should login through their social accounts to be verified.

**4.2. Account Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for all activities conducted under your account credentials. This includes maintaining the strict confidentiality and security of your password and login information.

**4.3. Security Breaches**: You must promptly notify Flaire immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access, misuse, or breach of your account security.

**4.4. Account Suspension/Termination**: Flaire reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account without prior notice if:

- Any information you provide is found to be false, incomplete, or misleading.
- You violate Platform policies or attempt to manipulate the system.
- There is unauthorized or fraudulent activity traced to your account.
- You violate applicable laws, these Terms, or our Community Guidelines.

Flaire is not liable for any damages or losses arising from unauthorized access or misuse of your account due to your failure to protect your credentials. Flaire retains discretion to deny, suspend, or terminate any account, particularly in cases involving community violations, fraud, or regulatory concerns.

## 5. User Roles & Obligations

**5.1. Creators**:

- Must create original content that adheres to Campaign deliverables.
- Must comply with all social media platform advertising regulations (and local advertising laws in Sri Lanka).
- Are strictly prohibited from using deceptive engagement tactics (e.g., fake followers, bots).
- Must maintain a satisfactory performance and approval rating, as determined by Flaire's internal metrics and Brand feedback, to continue accessing campaigns. Failure to do so may result in reduced campaign access or account review.

**5.2. Brands**:

- Must provide clear and comprehensive Campaign briefs, including objectives, key performance indicators (KPIs), monetary terms, and timelines.
- Are responsible for timely approvals or rejections of Deliverables (within 7 days of submission). Auto-approval may occur if no feedback is given within this timeframe.
- Must not request or promote unlawful, misleading, or unethical advertising content.
- Are legally responsible for all claims made in their marketing copy and Campaign briefs.

## 6. Campaign Agreement

A binding contract is formed directly between the Brand and the Creator once the following are completed:

1. The Brand initiates a Campaign on the Platform.
2. The Brand agrees to the agreement sent by the creator.
3. The full Campaign funds are securely deposited into Escrow.

**The Campaign brief will explicitly define the number of revisions included in the agreed-upon compensation.**

Any modification to an active Campaign requires mutual written consent between the Brand and Creator via the Platform. Astriv Solutions facilitates these agreements but is not a party to the direct contract between Brand and Creator. For any dispute resolution between Brands and Creators, Flaire will solely refer to the Campaign Agreement and communications conducted within the Platform. Conversations or agreements made outside the Platform do not fall under the responsibility of Flaire.

## 7. Escrow Payments & Release

**7.1. Escrow Funds**: Brands must deposit the total Deliverables amount, including all necessary taxes and Platform Fees, into Escrow before a Campaign commences.

**7.2. Approval & Release**: Following the Brand's approval of Deliverables, the final agreed-upon amount (minus applicable Platform Fees) will be disbursed to the Creator's registered bank account within 7 business days. Payments will be made to the bank account information provided by the Creator during registration or as updated within their Flaire account. Flaire is not responsible for any delays or failures in payment disbursement due to inaccurate or outdated bank details provided by the Creator, or due to the Creator losing access to their designated bank account.

Once funds are released upon Brand approval, Flaire is not liable for any subsequent changes or disputes related to the content or payment. If no feedback is provided by the Brand within 7 days of submission, auto-approval of Deliverables is assumed, triggering payment release.

**7.3. Dispute Handling**: Users must initiate a formal dispute via the Platform within 7 days of Deliverable submission.

- Astriv Solutions will facilitate mediation to help resolve disputes.
- Unresolved disputes may require escalation to external arbitration as per Section 18.
- Disputed funds will remain securely held in Escrow until a final resolution is reached.

## 8. Subscription & Platform Fees

Flaire offers tiered monthly subscription plans to unlock various features (e.g., advanced analytics, enhanced messaging, integrations).

- **Cancellation**: To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, cancellation must occur before the start of that cycle. Fees are non-refundable once a billing cycle has begun.
- **Fee Adjustments**: Astriv Solutions reserves the right to adjust its fee structures. Users will be notified of any changes in advance.

## 9. Intellectual Property & Licensing

**9.1. User Content**: Creators retain ownership of their original Deliverables. By accepting a Campaign, Creators grant Brands a specific license to use the Deliverables as defined by the Campaign terms (e.g., usage rights, duration, media channels). This license is strictly limited to the uses explicitly agreed upon in the Campaign brief. Any use beyond the scope of the original Campaign (e.g., for print ads, billboards, TV commercials, or extended digital campaigns not specified) requires a separate, new agreement and additional compensation between the Brand and Creator. Brands must credit Creators and obtain explicit permission for any alterations not covered by the original license.

**9.2. Platform IP**:

- All intellectual property rights in and to the Flaire Platform (including its code, design, features, trademarks, logos, and documentation) are exclusively owned by Astriv Solutions (Pvt) Ltd.
- You are prohibited from copying, reproducing, redistributing, selling, sublicensing, mirroring, framing, modifying, altering, or otherwise commercially exploiting any part of the Platform without express prior written consent from Astriv Solutions.
- Any third-party trademarks (e.g., Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Meta) are the property of their respective owners and do not imply affiliation with Flaire.

## 10. Data Protection & Privacy

We collect personal and campaign data to facilitate our services. Our handling and storage of your data comply with applicable Sri Lankan data protection laws and principles aligned with global best practices (e.g., GDPR).

- **Security**: Your personal data is stored securely using industry-standard encryption in transit and at rest. Access is strictly role-restricted.
- **Your Rights**: You can request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data held by us.
- **Full Policy**: Our comprehensive Privacy Policy, which details our data collection, usage, and protection practices, is incorporated here by reference and is available on our website.

## 11. Confidentiality

Users shall not disclose or exploit any confidential information gained through the Platform interactions for any purpose. These obligations continue for two (2) years post-account closure.

## 12. User Conduct & Prohibited Uses

Flaire will not provide tax advice or calculation services.

## 16. Warranties & Limitations of Liability
