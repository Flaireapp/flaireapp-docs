# Terms and Conditions
_Last updated: 18 November 2025_

These Terms govern your access to and use of the Flaire platform operated by Astriv Solutions (Pvt) Ltd. (“Flaire”, “we”, “us”). By creating an account or using any Flaire service you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Definitions
- **Platform** – the Flaire website, mobile apps, APIs, documentation, and related services.
- **Brand** – a company or agency sourcing creators on the Platform.
- **Creator** – an individual or entity offering creative services.
- **Campaign** – a collaboration between a Brand and a Creator facilitated through Flaire.
- **Deliverables** – the assets a Creator must produce under a Campaign Agreement.
- **Escrow** – the funds Flaire or its payment partners hold until Deliverables are approved.

## 2. Eligibility & Accounts
Users must be at least 18 years old, able to enter legally binding contracts, and not previously banned from Flaire. You must provide accurate information and keep your login credentials secure. Flaire may suspend or terminate accounts for policy or legal violations without prior notice.

## 3. Updates to Terms
We may modify these Terms. Material changes will be communicated via email or in-app notification at least 30 days in advance unless required sooner for legal or security reasons. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date constitutes acceptance.

## 4. User Responsibilities
### 4.1 Brands
- Publish truthful briefs and budgets.
- Approve or request revisions within seven days of submission.
- Fund campaigns before work begins and pay creators on time.

### 4.2 Creators
- Provide original work that meets the brief and complies with advertising laws.
- Disclose sponsored content in accordance with platform guidelines (e.g., #ad).
- Avoid fraudulent engagement tactics or misrepresentation of audience data.

## 5. Campaign Agreements
When a Creator accepts a brief and the Brand funds escrow, a binding contract is formed between the parties. Changes to scope, timelines, or fees must be agreed to in writing via the Platform. Flaire is not a party to Campaign Agreements but provides tools for record keeping and enforcement.

## 6. Escrow, Fees, and Payments
Brands must deposit the full campaign amount (including fees and taxes) before work begins. Flaire releases funds to Creators after Deliverables are approved or auto-approved per the campaign configuration. We may charge subscription fees, platform fees, or payment processing fees; these are non-refundable except where mandated by law.

## 7. Taxes
Brands and Creators are solely responsible for all taxes, duties, and filings related to their use of Flaire. We may collect tax forms (e.g., W-8BEN, W-9, local equivalents) to comply with regulations.

## 8. Intellectual Property
Creators retain ownership of their Deliverables unless otherwise agreed. By accepting a Campaign, Creators grant Brands the usage rights described in the brief. Users grant Flaire a limited license to host, display, and process content solely to operate and improve the Platform. Flaire’s trademarks, code, and design remain our exclusive property.

## 9. Data & Privacy
Our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy.mdx) explains how we collect and handle data. By using Flaire you consent to those practices, including cross-border data transfers consistent with applicable law.

## 10. Confidentiality
Information shared within campaigns (briefs, rates, unreleased product info) is confidential. Users may not disclose it outside the Platform without written consent, except when legally required.

## 11. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:
- Upload malicious code or attempt to gain unauthorized access
- Circumvent escrow or transact off-platform for active campaigns
- Harass, threaten, or discriminate against other users
- Share misleading metrics, fake followers, or fabricated case studies

## 12. Suspension & Termination
Flaire may suspend or terminate access for policy violations, suspected fraud, or legal risk. You may close your account at any time via settings. Closing an account does not relieve you of obligations incurred before termination.

## 13. Disputes Between Users
Disagreements over scope, quality, or payment must be raised through Flaire’s dispute center within ten days of deliverable submission. We will review evidence and may take actions such as refunding escrow or banning accounts. Our decision is final within the Platform.

## 14. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability
The Platform is provided “as is” without warranties of merchantability, fitness, or non-infringement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Flaire’s liability is limited to the greater of (a) fees you paid to Flaire during the three months before the claim or (b) LKR 500,000. Flaire is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

## 15. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Flaire, its affiliates, officers, and employees harmless from claims, damages, or expenses arising from your content, your breach of these Terms, or your misuse of the Platform.

## 16. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of Sri Lanka. Parties agree to first attempt informal resolution. If unresolved, disputes shall be settled by arbitration in Colombo under the Arbitration Act of Sri Lanka. Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for misuse of intellectual property or breach of confidentiality.

## 17. Notices
Official notices to Flaire can be sent to **legal@astrivsolutions.com** or Astriv Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., 333 Akarawita Mw., Homagama, Sri Lanka. Notices to you will be sent to the email associated with your account.

## 18. Entire Agreement
These Terms, plus any policies referenced herein (Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, Cookie Policy, campaign-specific agreements), constitute the entire agreement between you and Flaire.
