description: "Spin up a Flaire brand workspace in under ten minutes"
---

## Before you start
- A work email that matches your brand domain
- A PDF or image that proves you own or represent the brand (business registration, invoice, utility, or trademark certificate)
- Login credentials for at least one official brand social account (Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube) so Flaire can verify ownership and pull analytics later
- A short overview of the product or campaign you intend to run first
- Card or bank details to pay creators once you accept an agreement

## Step-by-step
1. **Create your workspace**
   - Visit [web.flaireapp.co](https://web.flaireapp.co) and select *Create brand account*.
   - Enter the legal name of the business, your role, and primary contact details.
   - Confirm the verification email titled *Activate your Flaire brand profile*.
2. **Upload proof of ownership**
   - Drag and drop a recent document that shows the company name and address.
   - Add a brief note linking the document to the product line you plan to campaign for.
   - Flaire reviews submissions within one business day. You will receive an email if we need a clearer document.
3. **Complete your collaboration profile**
   - Add a brand logo, preferred tone, and any mandatory disclosures you expect creators to use.
   - Outline the platforms you care about and any must-have content formats.
   - Connect at least one official social media handle so Flaire can confirm the brand identity and unlock analytics for future posts.
4. **Prepare to pay creators**
   - Add a debit/credit card or bank reference. Funds are only charged after you accept a creator’s agreement.
   - Set who inside your team is allowed to approve and pay for campaigns (optional).
5. **Post your first campaign**
   - Follow the lightweight form to describe the story, audience, deliverable date, and desired budget.
   - Once the campaign is live, it appears in the creator feed immediately.
   - Optional: copy the invite link or email creators directly from the confirmation screen if you already have partners in mind.

## Account review timeline
- **Instant approval:** Most brands pass within minutes when the document clearly shows ownership.
- **Manual review:** Regulated categories (finance, health, government) may take up to one business day.
- **Rejected submissions:** If the document does not match the brand, you can re-upload without creating a new account.
