## What you'll need
- A work email that matches your brand domain
- A PDF or image that proves you own or represent the brand (business registration, utility, or trademark certificate)
- Login credentials for at least one official brand social account (Instagram + Facebook,, TikTok, or YouTube) so Flaire can verify ownership and pull analytics later
- Card or bank details to pay creators once you accept an agreement

## Create your profile
1. Visit [web.flaireapp.co](https://web.flaireapp.co) and select *Sign Up*.
2. Enter your email and a password.
3. Verify your email by clicking the link emailed to your inbox.
4. Log back into flaire and select 'Brand' for account type.
5. Complete your collaboration profile and add any mandatory disclosures you expect creators to use.
6. Connect at least one official social media handle so Flaire can confirm the brand identity and unlock analytics for future posts.

## Next steps
- Read [Post a campaign](/brand-workflows/bw1) to learn what information creators expect to see.
- Share the [Applying as a creator guide](/creators) with partners who already work with you.
