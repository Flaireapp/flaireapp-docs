Use this snippet when you need to remind teams how Flaire handles brand
campaign requests:

> Brands must prove ownership of the products they list on Flaire. After the
> document check (and after both sides connect their social accounts), campaigns
> go live in the creator feed or via invite links. Every application already
> includes advance + final payment amounts, revision limits, and the delivery
> date. Once creators post and paste the live link, both sides see the same
> seven-day analytics snapshot, and the final payment is released when the brand
> approves or automatically after seven days.
