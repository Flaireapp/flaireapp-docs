## What you'll need
- A valid email and mobile number for verification
- Login access to at least one social account you plan to showcase (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)—connecting a social is required to finish signup
- A government-issued ID; Flaire requires it before your first payout
- Bank or payout details so you can receive advances and final payments

## Create your profile
1. Visit [web.flaireapp.co](https://web.flaireapp.co) and select *I'm a creator*.
2. Enter your name, email, phone number, and password.
3. Pick your primary categories and list the content formats you love creating.
4. Link at least one social account (more is better) so Flaire can verify your audience and unlock analytics once you start posting.
5. Upload 1–2 highlight links or files and write a short intro.
6. Submit the profile for review. Most approvals happen within an hour.

## Verification stages
| Stage | Why it matters | Timeline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email + phone | Confirms you control the login | Instant |
| Social link | Shows brands your real content and audience | Under 1 minute |
| ID check | Required before payouts are released | Within 24 hours |

## Tips for approval
- Keep the same name on your ID and profile to avoid delays.
- Make sure the social accounts you link are public during review.
- Mention the niches or brand categories you are most excited about—brands see this before you apply.
